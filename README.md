## Dependencies

This project uses CocoaPods to manage dependencies, so be sure to use the workspace file, not the project file. Hound uses the miso-specs repository for custom Miso CocoaPods specs. 

To set up the Miso CocoaPods specs, run the following command:

    pod repo add custom https://github.com/bazaarlabs/miso-specs.git
    
After adding dependencies to the Podfile, run the following command:

    pod install
